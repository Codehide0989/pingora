Until now, the badge was a PNG image. Now we provide an SVG instead to make it crystal clear. We are reducing the default style to a minimum.

Just copy the following code and paste it into your website or GitHub README:

```html
<img src="https://YOUR-SLUG.pingora.dev/badge/v2" className="border rounded-md overflow-hidden" />
```

And it will look like this:

<a href="https://status.pingora.dev">
  <img src="https://status.pingora.dev/badge/v2" />
</a>
