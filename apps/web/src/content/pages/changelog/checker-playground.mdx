You can now test your API or website from multiple regions around the world and
experience the performance of your application from the different continents.

Learn more about `dns`, `tls`, `ttfb` and more metrics that are collected by the
checker.

Go to the **[Playground](/play/checker)** to test your endpoint.

But there is more: use the `https://checker.pingora.dev/ping` API endpoint to
get the metrics by yourself.

For example:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://checker.pingora.dev/ping/ams \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-pingora-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  --header 'prefer-fly-region: ams' \
  --data '{
  "url": "https://api.pingora.dev/ping",
  "method": "GET"
}'
```

[Checker API](https://api.pingora.dev/v1#tag/monitor/POST/monitor/:id/run) in our docs.
