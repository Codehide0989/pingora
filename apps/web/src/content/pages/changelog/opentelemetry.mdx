We have added support for exporting your Pingora synthetic checks as OpenTelemetry metrics.

Check our [documentation](https://docs.pingora.dev/guides/how-to-export-metrics-to-otlp-endpoint/) for more information on how to set it up.

Here's an example of us exporting our synthetic checks to Grafana.

[Grafana X Pingora](https://pingora.grafana.net/public-dashboards/a85806536e9243f7ab9e0d458eb2ad32)

You just need an OTLP Endpoint to get started
