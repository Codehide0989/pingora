## What is a status page 🧑‍🏫

A status page is a public page that displays the status and performance of your
services. It shows the current status of your services and the history of
incidents.

You can create a status page with pingora and display the status of your synthetic checks.

You can see our own status page at [https://status.pingora.dev](https://status.pingora.dev).
