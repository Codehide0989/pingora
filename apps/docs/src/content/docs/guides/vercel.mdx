description: Learn how to deploy Pingora to Vercel.
---

 Pingora is designed to be easily deployed on Vercel. This guide will walk you through the steps to get your own instance running.

## Prerequisites

- A **GitHub** account to fork the repository.
- A **Vercel** account for deployment.
- A **Neon** account for the PostgreSQL database.
- A **Checkly** account (optional) for synthetic monitoring.

## 1. Database Setup (Neon)

1. Create a new project in [Neon](https://neon.tech).
2. Get your connection string. It should look like `postgresql://user:password@endpoint.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`.
3. Keep this handy, you will need it for the environment variables.

## 2. Fork and Deploy

1. Fork the [Pingora repository](https://github.com/pingora/pingora) to your GitHub account.
2. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and click **"Add New..."** -> **"Project"**.
3. Import your forked repository.

## 3. Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables in Vercel:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your Neon Database Connection String | `postgresql://...` |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | A random string for authentication security | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | The URL of your deployed application | `https://your-project.vercel.app` |

*(Note: There might be other variables needed depending on enabled features like email notifications, etc. check `.env.example` in the repo root)*

## 4. Build Settings

Vercel usually detects Next.js automatically. Ensure the following settings:
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Root Directory**: `apps/web` (if deploying the dashboard/web app) OR leave empty if using monorepo settings correctly. Pingora is a monorepo, so you might need to configure the **Root Directory** to `apps/web` or `apps/dashboard` depending on which app you are deploying.

For the **Dashboard** (`@pingora/web`):
- **Root Directory**: `apps/web` (or `apps/dashboard` check the repo structure)
- **Build Command**: `cd ../.. && pnpm build` (if custom build needed) or let Vercel handle turbo.

**Recommended:** Since this is a Turborepo, Vercel supports it out of the box. Ensure your `vercel.json` (if present) or Vercel project settings are configured to use `turbo`.

## 5. Deploy

Click **Deploy**. Vercel will build your application and deploy it.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection**: Ensure `sslmode=require` is present in your connection string.
- **Build Errors**: Check the build logs. If you see missing dependencies, ensure you are running `pnpm install` correctly (Vercel uses `pnpm` if `pnpm-lock.yaml` is present).

## Post-Deployment

Once deployed, visit your `NEXTAUTH_URL` to log in and start monitoring!
